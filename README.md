This repository is for creating a website for holding students accountable

### Getting Started
This project can be started by installing the node modules. 

Type `npm install` to get the node modules into the command line.

Type `npm start` to get onto the server to start editing data.

As of right now the only area where you can edit what is on the server in in views/index.pug. To convert html to pug you can use https://html-to-pug.com/ Also in the public file you will find css and a place to add images

Once you have finished doing `npm start` click on this link to see the website http://localhost:3000/

Before we can start developing applications we need to make sure we have a fully functional developer environment. We will be using VSCode as our editor, Google Chrome as our browser, and NodeJS as our backend environment. Getting all the tools setup and configured can take some time so make sure and start this as early as possible so if you hit any snags you can get help before the due date passes ðŸ˜ƒ.

Install VSCode and Git
Install NodeJS (https://nodejs.org/en/download)
Reboot your computer! Don't skip this step!
